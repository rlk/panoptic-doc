<h1>Panoptic</h1>

<p>Panoptic lets you interactively browse giga-pixel stereoscopic panoramas and high-resolution planetary surfaces on your laptop display, on your 3D TV, or with your Oculus Rift.</p>

<p>The common thread linking panoramas and planets is their spherical nature. A panorama is a sphere as seen from the inside, and a planet is a sphere as seen from the outside.</p>

<p>Panoptic is open source. Its code resides in the <a href="https://github.com/rlk/scmview">SCM View</a> project, which binds the <a href="https://github.com/rlk/scm">Spherical Cube Map</a> rendering library with the <a href="https://github.com/rlk/thumb">Thumb</a> virtual reality application framework.</p>

<p>Basic documentation appears in-application. It's enough to get you configured and browsing. The full feature set is documented here.</p>
